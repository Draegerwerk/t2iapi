  The ensemble-id is an identifier specified by the USER that uniquely refers to an SDC PARTICIPANT ENSEMBLE.
  To clarify which pm:EnsembleContextStates are needed, three examples are given.

  Example 1: treatment session
    The fact that a POC MEDICAL DEVICE is currently working in a (temporal) logical group based on a treatment session
    may be expressed by a pm:EnsembleContextDescriptor. If each of its pm:EnsembleContextStates describes a step in
    this treatment session, then the manipulation returns only the state handle of the pm:EnsembleContextState with
    @ContextAssociation = 'Assoc' that indicates membership in the logical group resp. SDC PARTICIPANT ENSEMBLE. The
    provided ensemble-id refers to this logical group resp. SDC PARTICIPANT ENSEMBLE. In this scenario there shall be
    only one pm:EnsembleContextState with @ContextAssociation = 'Assoc' at a time for the pm:EnsembleContextDescriptor.

  Example 2: location inferring
    If a pm:EnsembleContextDescriptor has multiple pm:EnsembleContextStates whereby each describes a membership of a
    location-inferred SDC PARTICIPANT ENSEMBLE if associated. The manipulation shall return the state handle of the
    pm:EnsembleContextState with @ContextAssociation = 'Assoc' that indicates membership in the SDC PARTICIPANT
    ENSEMBLE referred by the provided ensemble-id.

  Example 3: general hospital process
    Consider a general process within the hospital with multiple steps whereby each step is divided into multiple minor
    steps describing the major step more precisely. Membership of this main process as well as of the sub processes is
    modeled by a pm:EnsembleContextDescriptor that has multiple pm:EnsembleContextStates for the major as well as for
    the minor steps. To indicate membership in a sub process referred by the provided ensemble-id a
    pm:EnsembleContextState representing a major step and a pm:EnsembleContextState representing a major's minor step
    have to be associated. The manipulation shall return the state handles of both pm:EnsembleContextStates.

  The state shall be persistent until a next manipulation call. If the device is not able to maintain the static state,
  it shall return RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED.
