    Make available the BICEPS CONTAINMENT TREE ENTRY (as defined in IEEE Std 11073-10700-2022) that was previously
    represented by the provided handle in the MDIB with the provided @SequenceId. If the BICEPS CONTAINMENT TREE ENTRY

    If the BICEPS CONTAINMENT TREE ENTRY is already present in the current MDIB, only its handle shall be returned,
    no further action is required.

    Hint: Devices which use static handles for descriptors do not have to look up the entity that was previously
    represented by the requested handle, since they stay the same between the changes of the @SequenceId. It is
    sufficient to ensure the descriptor is present and return the handle.

    Example 1: returning the same handle for the Metric
    - device presented an MDIB with the Metric handle "metric_1" in @SequenceID "123"
    - device changes @SequenceID to "789" and presents a new MDIB
    - metric with the handle "metric_1" is still present in the current MDIB and represents the *same* metric
      as in @SequenceID "123"
    - InsertContainmentTreeEntryForSequenceId with handle="metric_1" and sequence_id="123" is executed
    - the handle "metric_1" is returned as the descriptor with this handle it is still available in the current MDIB
    - no further action from the device is required

    Example 2: returning a new handle for the MDS:
    - device presented an MDIB with MDS handle "mds0" in @SequenceID "123"
    - device changes @SequenceID to "789" and presents a new MDIB
    - MDS which had the Handle "mds0" in @SequenceId "123" is still present in the current MDIB, but it's Handle
      changed to "mds10"
    - InsertContainmentTreeEntryForSequenceId with handle="mds0" and sequence_id="123" is executed
    - the handle "mds10" is returned as the descriptor handle for that MDS has changed
    - no further action from the device is required

    Example 3: inserting the Channel into the current MDIB and returning the (new) handle:
    - device presented the Channel with handle "channel123" in @SequenceID "123"
    - device changes @SequenceID to "789" and presents a new MDIB
    - Channel which had the Handle "channel123" in @SequenceId "123" is no longer present in the current MDIB
    - InsertContainmentTreeEntryForSequenceId with handle="channel123" and sequence_id="123" is executed
    - Channel is inserted into the device's current MDIB with the handle "channel789"
    - the handle "channel789" is returned

    Example 1: inserting the MDS into the current MDIB:
      - devices is able to present a MDS with the handle mds1 which is currently not present in devices MDIB
      - InsertContainmentTreeEntryWithStaticHandle with handle mds1 is executed
      - MDS with the handle mds1 is inserted into the device's current MDIB
      - no further action from the device is required

    Example 2: Metric is already present in the current MDIB:
      - Metric with the handle "metric_1" is already present in the devices current MDIB
      - InsertContainmentTreeEntryWithStaticHandle with handle "metric_1" is executed
      - no further action from the device is required

    Example 3: the requested descriptor is not known for the device:
      - descriptor with the handle "some_channel" is not present in the devices current MDIB and no such descriptor can exist in the devices MDIB
      - InsertContainmentTreeEntryWithStaticHandle with handle "some_channel" is executed
